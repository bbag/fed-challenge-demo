## Things I would add with more time:
- Make the card grid responsive
- Break the card down into more components (e.g. a component for the card top, and one for the card bottom)
- Add ARIA labels for full accessibility
- Replace the animated card shadows on hover with a more performant work-around
- Inline the SVG icons for more flexible styling and optimize with sprites
